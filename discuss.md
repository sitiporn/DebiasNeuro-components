# Discussion

1. compare average ratio of every class for each set
2. is counterfactual force entailment set to much ? 
3. (2.)  if so it's effect prediction


# Finding outlier

1. this dataset is unormality 
2. plot single independent  plot for 
3. perform multivariate outliers detection

# Result 

NIE has a lot of outliers

1. change counterfactual -> let's see the the median of counterfactual
2. change NIE computation -> let's change the computation of Y by considered non-entailment class
3. Masking change token ?
