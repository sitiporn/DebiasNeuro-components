# Debias neural components leveraging Causal mediation analysis


## Todo
- [x] testing attention intervention
- [x] testing neurons intervention
- [x] grouping entailments by treatment
- [ ] naive approach on Indirect effect
    - [ ] save output pickle file of 
    - [ ] compute average score of every neurons from HOL set
    - [ ] compute average score of every neurons from LOL set
    - [ ] compute causal effect between HOL set and HOL set replaced by average output neurons of LOL set 
    - [ ] compute causal effect between LOL set and LOL set replaced by average output neurons of HOL set
    - [ ] compute causal effect of all samples between original one and the one replaced by average output neurons of HOL set and  LOL set


## Tackles
1. modifying embedding space to do counterfactual inference
2. modifying input and applying casual inference theory
